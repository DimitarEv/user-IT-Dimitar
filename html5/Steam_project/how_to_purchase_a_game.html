        <div class="p">1.<strong class="ph b">Utilize the search field function within the Steam store to search for the games you
                want to buy.</strong> If you do not have a particular game in mind to buy, you can use
            advanced search functions to seek for a game by genre, price, developer, publisher,
            category, operating system, and Metascore. <ul class="ul" id="how_to_purchase_a_game__ul_sfd_by3_5pb">
                <li class="li">To use the advanced search function, click on the magnifying glass icon next to
                    the search field and then click on "advanced search." Steam also lists current
                    top sellers as well as games that are on sale.</li>
            </ul></div>
        <p class="p">2.<strong class="ph b">View the games that catch your interest by left clicking on their icons or
                names.</strong> This will bring you to their information page, where you can view videos
            of games, view screen shots, read about games and their features, read reviews, and see
            system requirements. </p>
        <div class="p">3.<strong class="ph b">Add games to your shopping cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button.</strong> This
            button will also list the price of the game as well as indicate whether or not the game
            is currently on sale. This will also bring you to your newly created shopping cart. <ul class="ul" id="how_to_purchase_a_game__ul_tk2_hy3_5pb">
                <li class="li">If you have not previously done so, you will need to enter digital payment
                    information.</li>
            </ul></div>
        <p class="p">4.<strong class="ph b">Access your cart when you are ready to check out and buy the games you selected.</strong>
            Once you have items in your shopping cart, a green "cart" button will appear in the
            upper right portion of your steam application. It will also list, in parenthesis, the
            number of items you have in the cart. </p>
        <div class="p">5.<strong class="ph b">Choose whether to buy the game for yourself or whether you want to send it as a gift
                to a friend or family member.</strong><ul class="ul" id="how_to_purchase_a_game__ul_bk1_ly3_5pb">
                <li class="li">If you are sending the game as a gift, you can either have the information sent
                    to the person's email address with information on how to access the gift, or
                    allow them to unlock it directly through Steam.</li>
            </ul></div>
        <p class="p">6.<strong class="ph b">Finalize your order by viewing the "Review + Purchase" screen, checking the terms
                box, and clicking the "purchase" button.</strong></p>

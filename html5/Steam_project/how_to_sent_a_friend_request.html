    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">If the account you're looking to add is someone you know, the easiest way is to message
            them a Steam-generated "Friend Code." </p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">1. </strong>Open the Steam application and select "Friends" from the toolbar at the top of
            the app (or from the menu bar at the top of your screen on a Mac). Select "Add a Friend"
            from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">2. </strong>Steam gives you two options for sharing. First, you can send a generated Friend
            Code to a friend in any way you'd like. Once they receive it, they'll go to this same
            page and copy and paste the code into the text field. A small pop-up will appear with
            your friend's username, and you can click the blue "Send Invite" button to add them.</p>
        <p class="p">They'll get a notification that you've sent a friend request. When they accept the
            invite, you'll be added to each other's Friends List.</p>
